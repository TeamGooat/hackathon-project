## Context
A picture is worth 1000 words - in our case, a video is worth a million words. Have you ever had a question that was too complex to be answered through text, or wanted to obtain first hand responses from those that are knowledgeable in the domain or those that have been in your position? 

Other competitors only allow responses through chat, or from current students and staff. Our application stands out as it allows communication and collaboration from current students taking a course, cross-institutional students, staff and even alumni. With responsIO, you can now take difficult math and coding communication to the next level.
